# Generate text with GPT2 of OpenAI
In this repo you can find code of one of my hobby projects. I was wondering if machine learning could do some work for me with writing text. Since I prefer 'lazy' programming and actually using DeepLearning techniques, I wanted to find out if DeepLearning could help me write some text which would appear to be written by a human instead of something like the infamous quote out of the videogame 'Zero Wing': "All your base are belong to us."

Conclusion: it works pretty well and there is a lot of room to play around with the optional arguments to improve your output. 
Simply put in text and generate output using the GPT2 pre-trained DeepLearn model. Have fun!
