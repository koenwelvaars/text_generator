# Generate text with GPT2 of OpenAI
In this repo you can find code of one of my hobby projects. I was wondering if machine learning could do some work for me with writing text. Since I prefer 'lazy' programming and actually using DeepLearning techniques, I wanted to find out if DeepLearning could help me write some text which would appear to be written by a human instead of someout of the Borg in the Star Trek universe.

Conclusion: it works and you can play around with the optional arguments to see if this will improve your output. Simply put in text and generate output using the GPT2 pre-trained DeepLearn model.
